# Text Segmentation for Exam Assessment using Machine Learning

## Overview

The Online Examination System is designed to automate the assessment of theoretical answers submitted by students. It uses advanced text analysis techniques to compare a user's answer against a model answer and calculate a similarity percentage based on semantic properties. This system aims to streamline the grading process, ensuring fair and consistent assessments.

## Features

- **Automatic Assessment**: Evaluates user answers against model answers.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Analyzes semantic properties to determine similarity.
- **Tokenization**: Tokenizes data for analysis and matching.
- **Security**: Implements perimeter security, data security, and authentication.
- **Scalability**: Supports large data sets and high throughput data access.
- **Performance**: Designed for ease of development and management at scale.
- **Reliability**: Includes features like automated self-healing and data protection.
- **Compatibility**: Platform choice includes Ubuntu, Python 3, MongoDB, and cloud deployment.
